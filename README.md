<h1 align="">Hi, I'm Sandra 👋</h1>
<p>I've been coding <b>HTML/CSS</b> since I was about eleven. I've also spent a ridiculous amount of time creating <b>WordPress</b> themes.</p>
<p>Despite my love for code and design, I chose to become a psychologist, because I didn’t want to risk ruining my hobby by turning it into a job. And, at least to me, code and therapy are not so different – it's always fun to solve problems while trying to understand how and why people/things operate the way they do. 🧠</p>
<p>After seven years working as a psychologist, though, I'm willing to take a risk. I don't want to wake up one day thinking "what if...?"</p>
<p><b>Right now, I'm studying web development at Yrgo in Gothenburg, Sweden.</b></p>

<h2>When I'm not coding, I like to...</h2>

* Listen to music – preferably Rammstein :metal:
* Write – right now I'm working on a novel
* Watch tv-series – everything from Pride & Prejudice to Parks & Recreation
* Learn German – *Ich muss Deutsch lernen, weil ich Rammstein liebe* 🖤
