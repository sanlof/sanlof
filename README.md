<h1 align="">Hi, I'm Sandra 👋</h1>
<p>I've been coding <b>HTML/CSS</b> since I was eleven. I've also spent ridiculous amounts of time creating <b>WordPress</b> themes. 🎨</p>
<p>Despite my love for code and design, I initially chose to become a <b>psychologist</b>, because I didn’t want to risk ruining my hobby by turning it into a job. And, at least to me, code and therapy are not so different – it's always fun to solve problems while trying to understand how and why people/things operate the way they do. 🧠 💻 🔍 🤔</p>
<p>After seven years working as a psychologist, though, I'm willing to take a risk. I don't want to wake up one day thinking "what if...?"</p>
<p><b>Right now, I'm studying web development at Yrgo in Gothenburg, Sweden. 🍎</b></p>

<h2>When I'm not coding, I like to...</h2>

:metal: &nbsp; Listen to music – preferably Rammstein<br />
✍️ &nbsp; Write – right now I'm working on a novel<br />
📺 &nbsp; Watch tv-series – everything from Pride & Prejudice to Parks & Recreation<br />
🇩🇪 &nbsp; Learn German – *Ich muss Deutsch lernen, weil ich Rammstein liebe*
